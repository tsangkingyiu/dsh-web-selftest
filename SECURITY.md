# Security policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest released version is supported. Host compatibility is exact by default. Any manually widened `peerDependencies` range must be backed by recorded compatibility evidence and retested after a DeepSeek Harness upgrade.

## Security boundary

The generated tool transforms a caller-provided string in memory. It intentionally has no filesystem, subprocess, network, credential, persistence, scheduler, provider, or client-extension capability. It rejects unknown config and argument keys, honors cancellation before returning, and reports every truncation.

If any of those host powers are added, document the new authority source and failure policy, add negative tests, and follow the DeepSeek Harness Plugin Creator's risk-specific guidance before release.

## Reporting

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately to the repository maintainer. Do not include secrets, private source code, or live credentials in an issue.
